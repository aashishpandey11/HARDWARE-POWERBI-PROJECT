##  Conclusion

This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive end-to-end analysis of hardware product sales, financial performance, and supply chain efficiency across regions, customers, and product segments.

Key insights reveal that while revenue and gross margins are strong across top-performing products and markets, profitability is heavily impacted by rising operational costs and inaccurate demand forecasts — leading to excess inventory.

The dashboard enables data-driven decision-making by highlighting areas that require attention, such as cost optimization, improving forecast accuracy, and aligning inventory with actual demand. This makes it a valuable tool for sales, finance, and supply chain teams to monitor KPIs and take corrective actions to improve overall business performance.
